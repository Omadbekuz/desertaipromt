        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          Hello! I'm <strong>Omadbek</strong>, a passionate and self-taught{" "}
          <strong>web developer</strong> from Uzbekistan. Iâ€™m currently a
          student in <strong>11th grade</strong>, and even at the age of 17,
          Iâ€™ve built a strong foundation in modern web technologies.
        </p>

        <p>
          My main focus is on <strong>front-end development</strong>, and I have
          solid experience with:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</li>
          <li>ReactJS for building interactive web applications</li>
          <li>Node.js and Express.js for backend development</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          I actively share my knowledge through free programming lessons via my
          Telegram channel, <strong>"upuitc"</strong>, helping others learn web
          development from scratch.
        </p>

        <p>In addition to coding, I also:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Created my own personal portfolio website:{" "}
            <a
              href="https://omadbekportfolio.netlify.app"
              target="_blank"
              rel="noopener noreferrer"
            >
              omadbekportfolio.netlify.app
            </a>
          </li>
          <li>
            Work on real-world projects like a backend system for a clinic
          </li>
          <li>Plan to stream PUBG gameplay on YouTube</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Iâ€™m always eager to learn, experiment with new technologies, and build
          meaningful digital experiences. If youâ€™re looking for someone whoâ€™s
          creative, curious, and dedicated to growing in tech â€” Iâ€™m that person.
